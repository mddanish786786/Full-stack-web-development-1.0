Q. What is the internet ? Explain in your own words.

Ans. The internet is a vast network of interconnected computers and 
devices around the world. It allows these devices to communicate and 
share information with each other through a system of protocols and technologies. 
Essentially, it's like a gigantic web of digital highways that enables people to 
access websites, send emails, share files, stream videos, and much more. The internet 
has revolutionized the way we communicate, work, learn, and entertain ourselves, 
making information and resources more accessible to billions of people worldwide.

Q. What is a web browser? expalin in your own word.

Ans. A web browser is a software application that allows users to access and navigate 
the internet. It acts as a gateway to the vast array of information and resources available 
online. With a web browser, users can enter website addresses (URLs) or search terms to 
find and view web pages, images, videos, and other content.

Web browsers interpret and display web content, such as text, images, and multimedia, using 
various rendering engines. They also support features like bookmarks, tabs, history, and 
extensions, enhancing the browsing experience and providing users with tools to manage their online activities.

In simpler terms, a web browser is like a window to the internet, enabling users to explore 
and interact with websites and online services effortlessly.

Q. What is a browser engine? expalin in your own word.

Ans. A browser engine, also known as a layout engine, is a core component of a web browser responsible 
for rendering web pages. It interprets the code of a web page, typically written in languages like HTML, 
CSS, and JavaScript, and displays the content to the user in a visually appealing and interactive format.

Browser engines work behind the scenes to process the code of a web page and translate it into what users 
see on their screens. They handle tasks such as parsing HTML to determine the structure of the page, 
applying CSS styles to define its appearance, and executing JavaScript to add interactivity and dynamic behavior.

Different web browsers use different browser engines, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some popular 
browser engines include Blink (used by Google Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers), 
Gecko (used by Mozilla Firefox), and WebKit (used by Apple Safari).

In essence, a browser engine is like the brain of a web browser, responsible for interpreting and rendering 
web content to provide users with a seamless browsing experience.

Q. What is a static site? expalin in your own word.

Ans. A static site refers to a type of website that consists of web pages with fixed content that does not 
change unless manually updated by a developer. These websites are typically built using only HTML, CSS, and 
sometimes JavaScript, without relying on server-side processing or databases to generate content dynamically.

In a static site, each web page is pre-designed and stored as static files on a web server. When a user requests 
a page, the server simply serves the pre-built file, without any further processing or customization based on 
user input or other dynamic factors.

Static sites are often used for simple websites with relatively static content, such as blogs, portfolios, 
landing pages, or documentation sites. They tend to be faster, more secure, and easier to manage than dynamic 
websites because they don't require server-side processing or database interactions. However, they may be less 
flexible for websites that require frequent content updates or user interactions.

Q. What is a dynamic site? Explain in your own words.

Ans. A dynamic site refers to a type of website that generates web pages dynamically, meaning the content of the 
pages can change based on various factors such as user input, database queries, or other external data sources. 
Unlike static sites, where content is fixed and stored as static files, dynamic sites use server-side processing 
to generate customized content for each user request.

Dynamic sites typically involve server-side scripting languages like PHP, Python, Ruby, or ASP.NET, which allow 
developers to create web pages on-the-fly by executing code on the web server. These scripts interact with databases, 
APIs, or other external resources to retrieve and manipulate data, which is then used to generate HTML content 
dynamically before being sent to the user's web browser.

Examples of dynamic sites include e-commerce platforms, social media networks, content management systems (CMS), online 
forums, and web applications. Dynamic sites offer greater flexibility and interactivity compared to static sites, 
allowing for personalized user experiences, real-time updates, and complex functionality. However, they can be more 
complex to develop and maintain due to their reliance on server-side processing and data management.
