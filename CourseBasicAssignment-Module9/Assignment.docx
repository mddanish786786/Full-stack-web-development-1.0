Q. What is HTML?

Ans. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language. It is the standard markup language used to create and structure web pages 
and web applications. HTML provides a set of elements or tags that define the structure and content of a web page, 
including headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more.

HTML documents consist of a hierarchy of elements organized within a tree-like structure. Each element is enclosed within 
opening and closing tags, which define its type and properties. For example, <p> is the opening tag for a paragraph element, 
and </p> is the closing tag. Elements can also have attributes that provide additional information or modify their behavior, 
such as the src attribute in an image tag to specify the image source.

Web browsers interpret HTML documents and render them into visually formatted web pages that users can view and interact with. 
HTML works in conjunction with other web technologies such as CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling and layout, and JavaScript 
for interactivity and dynamic behavior, to create rich and interactive web experiences.

In summary, HTML is the foundational language of the World Wide Web, used to create the structure and content of web pages and 
applications, enabling users to access and interact with information and services on the internet.

Q. What is CSS?

Ans. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation and formatting of 
HTML documents, including web pages and web applications. CSS allows developers to define the visual appearance of elements 
on a web page, such as colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and more.

CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them using rulesets. A CSS ruleset consists of a selector, which 
identifies the HTML elements to be styled, and one or more declarations, which specify the styles to be applied. For example:


h1 {
    color: blue;
    font-size: 24px;
}
In this example, the CSS ruleset targets all <h1> elements and applies a blue color and a font size of 24 pixels.

CSS provides a wide range of styling capabilities, including:

Color and Typography: CSS allows you to specify colors, fonts, font sizes, font weights, and text alignments, enabling you 
to customize the appearance of text and typography on a web page.

Layout and Positioning: CSS provides layout properties such as width, height, margins, padding, and positioning 
(e.g., absolute, relative, fixed) to control the placement and arrangement of elements on the page.

Responsive Design: CSS supports responsive design techniques, allowing developers to create layouts that adapt and respond to 
different screen sizes and devices, such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Animations and Transitions: CSS includes properties for creating animations and transitions, enabling you to add visual effects 
and interactivity to elements on the page, such as fades, slides, and rotations.

Flexbox and Grid Layout: CSS introduces layout models such as Flexbox and CSS Grid, which provide powerful and flexible 
techniques for creating complex and responsive page layouts.

Q. Why did JavaScript come into the picture?

Ans. JavaScript emerged as a crucial component in web development for several reasons:

Client-Side Interactivity: Initially, web pages were static and lacked interactivity. JavaScript allowed developers to add 
dynamic behavior to web pages, enabling client-side interactivity such as form validation, interactive maps, animations, 
and more.

Enhanced User Experience: JavaScript enables developers to create more engaging and interactive user experiences. With JavaScript, 
developers can create dynamic interfaces that respond to user actions in real-time, providing a more fluid and responsive 
experience for users.

Asynchronous Programming: JavaScript supports asynchronous programming, allowing tasks to be executed independently of one 
another. This capability is essential for handling events, fetching data from servers, and performing operations without 
blocking the main execution thread, improving performance and responsiveness.

Cross-Browser Compatibility: JavaScript works across different web browsers, making it a versatile and widely supported language 
for web development. This cross-browser compatibility allows developers to create consistent experiences for users across various 
platforms and devices.

Server-Side Development: With the advent of Node.js, JavaScript has also become popular for server-side development. Node.js 
enables developers to build scalable and efficient server-side applications using JavaScript, leveraging its asynchronous and 
event-driven nature.

Rich Ecosystem: JavaScript has a vast ecosystem of libraries, frameworks, and tools that streamline development and enable 
developers to build complex web applications more efficiently. Popular frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue.js provide 
powerful abstractions for building user interfaces, while libraries like jQuery simplify DOM manipulation and AJAX requests.

Q. History of JavaScript and EcmaScript? Explain in your own words.

Ans. JavaScript, originally named LiveScript, was created by Brendan Eich while he was working at Netscape Communications 
Corporation in 1995. It was initially developed as a scripting language for web browsers to add interactivity and dynamic 
behavior to web pages. In December 1995, JavaScript was released with Netscape Navigator 2.0, marking the beginning of its 
journey as a crucial component of web development.

As JavaScript gained popularity, standardization became necessary to ensure interoperability and consistency across different 
web browsers. In 1997, Netscape submitted JavaScript to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) for standardization. 
The standardization effort led to the creation of the first edition of the ECMAScript specification, officially named 
ECMAScript 1, published in June 1997.

Over the years, ECMAScript evolved with subsequent editions introducing new features, improvements, and clarifications to the 
language. Notable editions include ECMAScript 3 (1999), which standardized many features found in modern JavaScript 
implementations, ECMAScript 5 (2009), which introduced significant enhancements such as strict mode, JSON support, 
and new array methods, and ECMAScript 6 (2015), also known as ES6 or ES2015, which introduced major language enhancements 
including arrow functions, classes, modules, and promises.

Since ECMAScript 6, the ECMAScript specification has been updated annually, with new editions introducing additional features 
and improvements. This rapid release cycle aims to ensure that JavaScript continues to evolve and meet the changing needs of 
web developers and the web ecosystem.
