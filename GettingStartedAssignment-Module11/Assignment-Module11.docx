Q. Why do w start learning a programming language with â€œHello World?


Ans. Starting to learn a programming language with a "Hello World" program is a tradition and serves several purposes:

Introduction to Syntax: Writing a "Hello World" program introduces beginners to the basic syntax and structure of the 
programming language. It typically involves minimal code, allowing newcomers to focus on understanding fundamental concepts 
like variable declaration, function syntax, and basic program flow.

First Hands-On Experience: By writing and running a "Hello World" program, beginners get their first hands-on experience 
with coding. They learn how to write code, save it in a file, and execute it, which helps build confidence and motivation 
to continue learning.

Verification of Setup: Running a "Hello World" program serves as a quick test to verify that the development environment is 
set up correctly. It ensures that the compiler or interpreter is installed and configured properly, and that the code editor 
is functioning as expected.

Immediate Feedback: After writing the "Hello World" program and running it, beginners receive immediate feedback that confirms 
they have written the code correctly and that it is executing as intended. This feedback loop is crucial for learning and 
problem-solving.

Cultural and Historical Significance: "Hello World" programs have a cultural and historical significance in the world of 
programming. They date back several decades and are used across various programming languages as the simplest and most iconic 
example of code execution.

Q. How is the us of comments and how do you writ comments in HTML?


Ans. Comments in HTML are used to provide additional information, explanations, or notes within the code. They are ignored by 
web browsers and are not displayed in the rendered output of the web page. Comments are helpful for documenting the HTML code, 
providing context for other developers, or temporarily disabling code for testing purposes.

To write comments in HTML, you use the <!-- and --> delimiters. Anything between these delimiters is considered a comment and 
will not be processed by the browser. Here's an example:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>My Web Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <!-- This is a comment -->
    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
</body>
</html>
In the example above, the comment <!-- This is a comment --> will not be visible on the rendered web page. It serves as a note 
or explanation for developers working on the HTML code. Comments in HTML are useful for documenting the structure of the document,
providing explanations for specific elements or sections, or temporarily disabling code for debugging purposes.

Q. What are elements, tags and attributes and the difference between them?

Ans.  In HTML, elements, tags, and attributes are fundamental concepts used to structure and define the content and presentation of web pages:

Elements:

Elements are the building blocks of HTML documents.
They represent the structure and content of the document, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links.
Each element consists of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag (in most cases). For example, <p>Hello, World!</p> is a 
paragraph element with opening <p> and closing </p> tags.
Elements can be nested within each other to create hierarchical structures, with parent elements containing child elements.
Tags:

Tags are the markup characters used to define the beginning and end of HTML elements.
They consist of angle brackets (< and >) surrounding the element name.
Tags come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag indicates the beginning of an element, and the closing tag 
indicates the end of the element. For example, <p> is the opening tag for a paragraph element, and </p> is the closing tag.
Some elements, such as line breaks <br> and image elements <img>, do not require a closing tag and are called self-closing or 
void elements.
Attributes:

Attributes provide additional information or properties to HTML elements.
They are specified within the opening tag of an element and consist of an attribute name followed by an equals sign (=) and a 
value enclosed in quotation marks (").
Attributes modify the behavior, appearance, or functionality of elements. Common attributes include class, id, src, href, alt, 
style, and title.
For example, <img src="example.jpg" alt="Example Image"> is an image element (<img>) with src and alt attributes specifying the 
image source and alternative text, respectively.

Q.  Briefly explain what HTML Entities are?


Ans.  HTML entities are special codes used to represent characters that have special meaning or reserved use in HTML documents. 
These characters, such as <, >, ", ', and &, are referred to as reserved characters. When used in HTML code directly, these 
characters can be misinterpreted by browsers as part of the HTML syntax rather than as literal characters.

HTML entities provide a way to display reserved characters as text on a web page without causing parsing errors or unintended 
behavior. Each HTML entity consists of an ampersand (&) followed by a predefined name or numerical code, and ends with a 
semicolon (;). For example:

&lt; represents the less-than symbol <.
&gt; represents the greater-than symbol >.
&quot; represents the double quotation mark ".
&apos; represents the apostrophe or single quotation mark '.
&amp; represents the ampersand &.
Using HTML entities ensures that reserved characters are displayed correctly and do not interfere with the interpretation of 
HTML code by browsers. They are commonly used when writing HTML code directly, especially when including special characters 
within text content, attribute values, or URLs.
